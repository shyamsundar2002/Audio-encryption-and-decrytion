# ABOUT
The Audio encryption and decryption is a tool that can be used to secure 
audio files from unauthorized access or use. It involves the use of 
mathematical algorithms to convert audio data into a scrambled form, 
which can only be deciphered by someone with the appropriate decryption 
key. 

  There is a significant scope for audio encryption and decryption in 
various industries such as music, film, and broadcasting. These industries 
deal with sensitive audio data that needs to be protected from piracy or 
unauthorized use. Audio encryption and decryption can provide an 
effective way to secure such data and prevent it from falling into the wrong 
hands. 

  Moreover, audio encryption and decryption can also be used for 
personal use by individuals who want to secure their audio files, such as 
personal recordings or voice messages. It can prevent anyone from 
accessing their audio files without the appropriate decryption key, ensuring 
their privacy and confidentiality.
